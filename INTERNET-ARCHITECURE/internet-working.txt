# 1. What Is the Internet?

The **Internet** is a **global network of interconnected computer networks** that communicate using standardized protocols, primarily **TCP/IP**.

* It is **not** a single entity or server
* It is a **network of networks**
* Anyone can connect if they follow the Internet standards

**Key idea:**

> The Internet is infrastructure.
> The Web is a service built on top of the Internet.

# 2. Internet vs World Wide Web (WWW)

| Internet                   | World Wide Web               |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Physical + logical network | Application/service          |
| Uses TCP/IP                | Uses HTTP/HTTPS              |
| Exists since 1960s–70s     | Created in 1989              |
| Supports email, FTP, VoIP  | Supports websites & web apps |

**Other Internet services:**

* Email (SMTP, POP3, IMAP)
* File Transfer (FTP, SFTP)
* Messaging
* Video conferencing
* Cloud services

# 3. Brief History of the Internet

## 3.1 ARPANET (1960s)

* Created by **US Department of Defense**
* Goal: **Communication even if part of network fails**
* Used **packet switching** instead of circuit switching

## 3.2 TCP/IP Adoption (1983)

* TCP/IP became the standard
* Enabled different networks to interconnect
* Birth of the modern Internet

## 3.3 World Wide Web (1989)

* Invented by **Tim Berners-Lee**
* Introduced:

  * HTML
  * HTTP
  * URL
  * Web browsers

## 3.4 Commercial Internet (1990s)

* ISPs emerged
* Websites became public
* E-commerce started

## 3.5 Web Evolution

| Era     | Name                     | Description                |
| ------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| Web 1.0 | Static Web               | Read-only pages            |
| Web 2.0 | Interactive Web          | Social media, user content |
| Web 3.0 | Semantic / Decentralized | AI, blockchain             |
| Web 4.0 | Intelligent Web          | AI-driven experiences      |

# 4. How the Internet Works (Step-by-Step)

### Example: You type `www.google.com`

---

## Step 1: URL Breakdown

```
https://www.google.com/search?q=web
```

| Part                                    | Meaning      |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| https                                   | Protocol     |
| [www.google.com](http://www.google.com) | Domain name  |
| /search                                 | Path         |
| ?q=web                                  | Query string |

---

## Step 2: DNS Resolution (Domain → IP)

Computers communicate using **IP addresses**, not domain names.

**DNS process:**

1. Browser checks cache
2. OS checks cache
3. Router checks cache
4. ISP DNS server
5. Root DNS → TLD DNS → Authoritative DNS

**Result:**

```
www.google.com → 142.250.xxx.xxx
```

---

## Step 3: TCP Connection (3-Way Handshake)

1. Client → SYN
2. Server → SYN-ACK
3. Client → ACK

Connection established.

---

## Step 4: HTTPS Security (TLS Handshake)

* Server sends SSL certificate
* Browser verifies certificate
* Encryption keys exchanged
* Secure communication starts

---

## Step 5: HTTP Request & Response

### Request:

```
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: www.google.com
```

### Response:

```
200 OK
Content-Type: text/html
```

HTML is sent back.

---

## Step 6: Browser Rendering

Browser parses:

1. HTML → DOM
2. CSS → CSSOM
3. JS → Execution
4. Layout
5. Paint
6. Composite

---

# 5. Internet Architecture

## 5.1 Client–Server Model

* Client: Browser, mobile app
* Server: Hosts resources
* Stateless communication (HTTP)

---

## 5.2 Peer-to-Peer (P2P)

* No central server
* Examples:

  * BitTorrent
  * Blockchain
  * WebRTC

---
